# General information
| Name: | Anastasiya Ivanova |
> I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. Invited to join my friend's start-up company as a front-end developer, I gained experience of working in this area. 
As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.
